Food packaging solutions need to be  redesigned to be  more sustainable, 
but determining which solution is ‘more optimal’ is a very difficult task when 
considering the entire food product value chain. Previous papers paved the way 
toward a sustainable food packaging definition, but it is far from being commonly 
accepted or well usable in the broad food systems domain, which further results 
in uninformed choices for sustainable food packaging made by all stakeholders in 
the value chain: producers, distributors, practitioners and consumers. Therefore, 
this work aims first at giving a state-of-the-art overview of sustainable food 
packaging terms (38 similar terms were identified and grouped into four clusters: 
Sustainable, Circular, Bio and Other sustainable packaging) and definitions using 
systematic (narrative) review analysis and ‘controlled expert opinion feedback’ 
methodology. Second, it aims to offer an updated definition for sustainable food 
packaging, which is also specific to food packaging and be simple, coherent, easily 
understandable, and communicable to everybody. The applied holistic approach 
intends to include all aspects of the food-packaging unit, to consider food safety 
and packaging functionality, while taking into account different disciplines and 
challenges related to food packaging along the supply chain. Being a balancing 
act, a sustainable food packaging may not be a perfect solution, but contextual, 
suboptimal and in need of constant validation.
