RAG-Sequence
:
 
 
○
 
The
 
generator
 
processes
 
each
 
retrieved
 
document
 
sequentially.
 
○
 
Produces
 
multiple
 
responses,
 
one
 
for
 
each
 
document,
 
and
 
selects
 
the
 
most
 
relevant
 
one.
 
2.
 
RAG-Token
:
 
 
○
 
The
 
generator
 
integrates
 
information
 
from
 
multiple
 
documents
 
at
 
the
 
token
 
level.
 
○
 
Provides
 
a
 
more
 
comprehensive
 
and
 
coherent
 
response
 
by
 
combining
 
insights
 
from
 
all
 
retrieved
 
documents.
 
 
Advantages
 
of
 
RAG
 
1.
 
Enhanced
 
Knowledge
:
 
 
○
 
Combines
 
pre-trained
 
language
 
models
 
with
 
external
 
knowledge
 
bases
 
for
 
broader
 
and
 
up-to-date
 
information.
 
2.
 
Reduced
 
Hallucination
:
 
 
○
 
Incorporates
 
factual
 
data
 
from
 
retrieved
 
documents,
 
reducing
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
generating
 
incorrect
 
or
 
fabricated
 
information.
 
3.
 
Modularity
:
 
 
○
 
The
 
retriever
 
and
 
generator
 
components
 
can
 
be
 
improved
 
independently,
 
allowing
 
for
 
flexibility
 
and
 
customization.
 
4.
 
Scalability
:
 
 
○
 
Works
 
effectively
 
with
 
large-scale
 
knowledge
 
bases
 
using
 
efficient
 
retrieval
 
methods.
 
 
Applications
 
of
 
RAG
 
1.
 
Question
 
Answering
:
 
 
○
 
Improves
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
answers
 
by
 
using
 
external
 
documents
 
for
 
context.
 
2.
 
Chatbots
:
 
 
○
 
Enables
 
chatbots
 
to
 
provide
 
more
 
informed
 
and
 
contextually
 
rich
 
responses.
 
3.
 
Document
 
Summarization
:
 
 
○
 
Uses
 
retrieved
 
information
 
to
 
generate
 
summaries
 
for
 
specific
 
topics
 
or
 
queries.
