Sustainable packaging (9)
Sustainable packaging By using the word ‘sustainable’ the concept of sustainability is applied to the field of Orzan et al. (2018); Grönman et al.
packaging production (product/package systems). It includes insertion of the goals (2013); Magnier and Schoormans
of sustainable development (economic, social and environment) into the life cycle of (2015); Boz et al. (2020); Martinho
packaging, from cradle to grave, throughout each stage of the supply chain. As a et al. (2015); Nordin and Selke (2010)
result, sustainable packaging is perceived as safe, healthy, market-efficient, and cost-
effective, which is obtained, produced, transported, and recycled via sources of
renewable energy, as well as with the use of renewable or recyclable materials; it also
utilizes clean production technologies and best practices; is designed to optimize the
materials and energy used, and can be effectively recovered and reused in numerous
production cycles.
Environmentally friendly packaging; These terms are all related to a packaging innovation strategy, which contributes to Nguyen et al. (2020); Prakash et al.
Eco-friendly packaging; Ecologically the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and accomplishes (2019); Prakash and Pathak (2017);
responsible packaging; Ecologically a balance of ecological, social, and economic development. It causes less Scott and Vigar-Ellis (2014); Ketelsen
conscious packaging; Pro-environmental environmental harm than traditional packaging, makes efficient use of materials, et al. (2020); Koenig-Lewis et al.
packaging; Ecologically packaged leads to less solid waste, and reduces food losses and waste. It is usually constructed (2014); Yokokawa et al. (2018); Zeng
products; Eco-design(ed) packaging according to life cycle assessment (LCA), features multiple sustainable attributes, and et al. (2021); Zeng et al. (2020); Zeng
evokes explicitly or implicitly consumers’ eco-friendliness. and Durif (2020); Magnier and Crié
(2015)
Green packaging Green packaging clearly highlights its impact on waste and pollution, uses ecological Wandosell et al. (2021); Ahmed and
materials, or manufacturing techniques which avoid potentially toxic constituents for Varshney (2011)
human health and the environment.
Circular packaging (14)
Circular packaging; Zero waste packaging Circular packaging is designed according to the principles of the circular economy Testa et al. (2020); Jäger and Piscicelli
(recycled content, reusability, design for disassembly, and recyclability) to preserve (2021); Song et al. (2015)
the natural resources, optimize their use, and minimize the negative impact on the
environment. Zero waste packaging is specifically focused on the material flow, with
no waste. However, often confused for zero landfill. In this case also, at end of life the
packages are reused, repaired, or redistributed within the system.
Recyclable packaging Recyclable packaging is made of materials that can be re-introduced within the circle Muranko et al. (2021), Wang et al.
with the help of disposal, collection, sorting, and reprocessing with mechanical or (2021)
chemical methods. Efficiency or economics are not included in this definition, nor if
recycling is down-cycling.
Recycled packaging; Post-consumer Recycled packaging is made of recycled materials (e.g.: post-consumer recycled Van Sluisveld and Worrell (2013);
recycled content packaging; Ocean plastic content or ocean plastic) subsequently saving the need to use new, virgin material. Magnier et al. (2019)
packaging; Beach plastic packaging;
Reusable packaging; Closed-loop Reusable packaging is a waste management strategy and combines forward Muranko et al., 2021; Accorsi et al.,
packaging; Returnable packaging; Multi- distribution operations with reverse logistics, which involves an operation (handling, 2020; Van Sluisveld and Worrell, 2013;
way packaging; Non-disposable storage, and transport) by which products or components are used again for the Vöröskői et al. (2020); Dubiel, 1996;
packaging; Durable packaging; Refillable same purpose for which they were conceived. This saves the need to use new Böröcz, 2023
packaging material.
Bio packaging (10)
Bio-based packaging; Plant based Bio-packaging refers to materials which are either bio-based, from renewable raw Gontard and Guilbert (1994);
packaging; Biomaterial based packaging; materials originating from biological resources (such as agricultural or marine Lomartire et al. (2022); Reichert et al.
Bioplastic packaging; Biopolymer sources: microbial resources like microbial cellulose, polyhydroxyalkanoates, (2020); Cutter (2006); Santhosh et al.
packaging; Biopackaging polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and/or resins), or bio-degradable or have both (2021); Cruz et al. (2022)
properties. It includes bio-based packaging which may not be recyclable or
biodegradable, or fossil fuel-based yet biodegradable.
Bio-degradable packaging; Oxo- Biodegradable packaging describes alternative end-of-life scenarios for packaging Reichert et al. (2020); Ivonkovic et al.
degradable packaging materials where its breakdown occurs via industrial or home-composting. Fossil (2017); Allison et al. (2021); Cruz et al.
fuel-based packaging that is bio-degradable can also be in this definition. (2022); Zaborowska et al. (2021)
