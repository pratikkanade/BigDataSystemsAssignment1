Sustainable packaging (9),,
Sustainable packaging,"By using the word ‘sustainable’ the concept of sustainability is applied to the field of
packaging production (product/package systems). It includes insertion of the goals
of sustainable development (economic, social and environment) into the life cycle of
packaging, from cradle to grave, throughout each stage of the supply chain. As a
result, sustainable packaging is perceived as safe, healthy, market-efficient, and cost-
efefctive, which is obtained, produced, transported, and recycled via sources of
renewable energy, as well as with the use of renewable or recyclable materials; it also
utilizes clean production technologies and best practices; is designed to optimize the
materials and energy used, and can be efefctively recovered and reused in numerous
production cycles.","Orzan et al. (2018); Grönman et al.
(2013); Magnier and Schoormans
(2015); Boz et al. (2020); Martinho
et al. (2015); Nordin and Selke (2010)"
"Environmentally friendly packaging;
Eco-friendly packaging; Ecologically
responsible packaging; Ecologically
conscious packaging; Pro-environmental
packaging; Ecologically packaged
products; Eco-design(ed) packaging","Tehse terms are all related to a packaging innovation strategy, which contributes to
the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and accomplishes
a balance of ecological, social, and economic development. It causes less
environmental harm than traditional packaging, makes efficient use of materials,
leads to less solid waste, and reduces food losses and waste. It is usually constructed
according to life cycle assessment (LCA), features multiple sustainable attributes, and
evokes explicitly or implicitly consumers’ eco-friendliness.","Nguyen et al. (2020); Prakash et al.
(2019); Prakash and Pathak (2017);
Scott and Vigar-Ellis (2014); Ketelsen
et al. (2020); Koenig-Lewis et al.
(2014); Yokokawa et al. (2018); Zeng
et al. (2021); Zeng et al. (2020); Zeng
and Durif (2020); Magnier and Crié
(2015)"
Green packaging,"Green packaging clearly highlights its impact on waste and pollution, uses ecological
materials, or manufacturing techniques which avoid potentially toxic constituents for
human health and the environment.","Wandosell et al. (2021); Ahmed and
Varshney (2011)"
Circular packaging (14),,
Circular packaging; Zero waste packaging,"Circular packaging is designed according to the principles of the circular economy
(recycled content, reusability, design for disassembly, and recyclability) to preserve
the natural resources, optimize their use, and minimize the negative impact on the
environment. Zero waste packaging is specifically focused on the material flow, with
no waste. However, ofetn confused for zero landfill. In this case also, at end of life the
packages are reused, repaired, or redistributed within the system.","Testa et al. (2020); Jäger and Piscicelli
(2021); Song et al. (2015)"
Recyclable packaging,"Recyclable packaging is made of materials that can be re-introduced within the circle
with the help of disposal, collection, sorting, and reprocessing with mechanical or
chemical methods. Efficiency or economics are not included in this definition, nor if
recycling is down-cycling.","Muranko et al. (2021), Wang et al.
(2021)"
"Recycled packaging; Post-consumer
recycled content packaging; Ocean plastic
packaging; Beach plastic packaging;","Recycled packaging is made of recycled materials (e.g.: post-consumer recycled
content or ocean plastic) subsequently saving the need to use new, virgin material.","Van Sluisveld and Worrell (2013);
Magnier et al. (2019)"
"Reusable packaging; Closed-loop
packaging; Returnable packaging; Multi-
way packaging; Non-disposable
packaging; Durable packaging; Refillable
packaging","Reusable packaging is a waste management strategy and combines forward
distribution operations with reverse logistics, which involves an operation (handling,
storage, and transport) by which products or components are used again for the
same purpose for which they were conceived. This saves the need to use new
material.","Muranko et al., 2021; Accorsi et al.,
2020; Van Sluisveld and Worrell, 2013;
Vöröskői et al. (2020); Dubiel, 1996;
Böröcz, 2023"
Bio packaging (10),,
"Bio-based packaging; Plant based
packaging; Biomaterial based packaging;
Bioplastic packaging; Biopolymer
packaging; Biopackaging","Bio-packaging refers to materials which are either bio-based, from renewable raw
materials originating from biological resources (such as agricultural or marine
sources: microbial resources like microbial cellulose, polyhydroxyalkanoates,
polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and/or resins), or bio-degradable or have both
properties. It includes bio-based packaging which may not be recyclable or
biodegradable, or fossil fuel-based yet biodegradable.","Gontard and Guilbert (1994);
Lomartire et al. (2022); Reichert et al.
(2020); Cutter (2006); Santhosh et al.
(2021); Cruz et al. (2022)"
"Bio-degradable packaging; Oxo-
degradable packaging","Biodegradable packaging describes alternative end-of-life scenarios for packaging
materials where its breakdown occurs via industrial or home-composting. Fossil
fuel-based packaging that is bio-degradable can also be in this definition.","Reichert et al. (2020); Ivonkovic et al.
(2017); Allison et al. (2021); Cruz et al.
(2022); Zaborowska et al. (2021)"
