Compostable packaging,"Compostable packaging refers to materials which break down and degrade in the
environment, but consists of only organic elements that degrade in the environment
without leaving any toxic residue. All compostable materials are biodegradable, but
not all biodegradable materials are compostable.","Reichert et al. (2020); Allison et al.
(2021)"
"Edible packaging (films, coatings)","Edible packaging is a wrapping or coating that is an integral part of the (food)
product, fully degradable and can be eaten with the product.","Petkoska et al. (2021); Janjarasskul and
Krochta (2010); Kadzi≈Ñska et al. (2019);
Cutter (2006)"
Other sustainable packaging (5),,
(Eco) Refill packaging,"Refill packaging prolongs the lifetime of (parent) packaging through a second more
lightweight and flexible packaging (but also considered as a supplementary one-way
product).",Van Sluisveld and Worrell (2013)
Non-excessive packaging,"Non-excessive packaging refers to a packaging redesign, where abundant
components are removed without compromising other packaging functions, quality,
and esthetics.",Van Sluisveld and Worrell (2013)
"Lightweight packaging; Downgauging
packaging","Lightweight packaging decreases the external dimensions of packaging, while
maintaining similar inner dimensions, while ofefring the same or an enhanced
packaging strength [e.g.: reducing the average thickness of the original material;
replacing original material for a more lightweight alternative (composite)].",Van Sluisveld and Worrell (2013)
Innovative packaging,"This includes novel materials in mono- or multilayers while decreasing the
environmental pressure by considering a broad range of sustainability issues (e.g.:
waste prevention, efficient use of resources, process optimization, recycle, reuse).
Innovative packaging is more of a design and holistic approach.","Reichert et al. (2020); Vanderroost et al.
(2014)"
