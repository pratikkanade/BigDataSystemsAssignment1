Food  packaging  solutions  need  to  be  redesigned  to  be  more  sustainable, but determining which solution is 'more optimal' is a very di/fficult task when considering the entire food product value chain. Previous papers paved the way toward a sustainable food packaging definition, but it is far from being commonly accepted or well usable in the broad food systems domain, which further results in uninformed choices for sustainable food packaging made by all stakeholders in the value chain: producers, distributors, practitioners and consumers. Therefore, this work aims first at giving a state-of-the-art overview of sustainable food packaging terms (38 similar terms were identified and grouped into four clusters: Sustainable, Circular, Bio and Other sustainable packaging) and definitions using systematic (narrative) review analysis and 'controlled expert opinion feedback' methodology. Second, it aims to o/ffer an updated definition for sustainable food packaging, which is also specific to food packaging and be simple, coherent, easily understandable, and communicable to everybody. The applied holistic approach intends to include all aspects of the food-packaging unit, to consider food safety and packaging functionality, while taking into account di/fferent disciplines and challenges related to food packaging along the supply chain. Being a balancing act, a sustainable food packaging may not be a perfect solution, but contextual, suboptimal and in need of constant validation.

## 1. Introduction

Food packaging solutions are widely recognized to produce multiple advantages within the whole food supply chain and related stakeholders, but the present consumption rate of materials, linear production and consumption models used for packaging, and their littering make the current situation no longer bearable. /T\_he current packaging  solutions  for  food  need  to  be  redesigned  in  a  more sustainable way (Herbes et al., 2020; Testa et al., 2020). Without a doubt, the environmental problems caused by (fossil fuel-based plastic and high resource intensive materials) packaging need to be tackled by launching new solutions, focusing on refuse, reuse, replace, reduce as well as recycle such materials (see e.g.: Papargyropoulou et al., 2014; Knauf, 2015;  Van Ewijk and Stegemann, 2016). /T\_he concept of packaging sustainability-in accordance with the Brundtland Report (Keeble, 1988), is de/fined as a 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'-has been one of the most highly discussed topics for some time (Nordin and Selke, 2010;  Boz et al., 2020; Ketelsen et al., 2020), and has been an emerging area of interest for scholars and practitioners around the world (Ketelsen et al., 2020; Vila-Lopez and Küster-Boluda, 2020; Wandosell et al., 2021).

Previous papers paved the way toward a sustainable food packaging de/finition (Wikström et al., 2019; Camilleri, 2020; Morseletto, 2020), but it is far from being commonly accepted or well usable in the broad food systems domain. Companies (such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Tesco), organizations  [such  as  Sustainable  Packaging  Alliance  (SPA)  and Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC)] and academic researchers with di/fferent academic  backgrounds  (economic,  material  sciences, environmental management, etc.) have formulated various de/finitions, which are not fully aligned (Pauer et al., 2019). /T\_he lack of agreement is leading to confusion not only among consumers, who already struggle with identifying sustainable packaging solutions at the point of sale (Boz et al., 2020; Acuti et al., 2022), but presumably also among legislators and other supply chain members (Trubetskaya et al., 2022). Lack of a widely accepted de/finition (or use of strict versus vague de/finitions) may lead to major inconsistencies, even to misleading consumers, greenwashing or fraud. When there is no clear understanding of what a sustainable food packaging is, consumers can make wrong choices even with the best of their  intentions,  from  a  sustainable  point  of  view  (information asymmetry; Akerlof, 1970). /T\_his for example may lead to preferring the less sustainable packaging at the expense of the more sustainable one, which then may even disappear from the market. /T\_his becomes even more complicated in situations where organizational changes are needed, as for example in tackling solutions linked to re-use of packaging.

/T\_his  intrinsic  controversy  that  characterizes  food  products complicates the de/finition of sustainability in the packaging /field. Current de/finitions on sustainability of packaging solutions are o/f\_ten associated with only waste reduction and pollution prevention. For example, the current EU strategies toward the circular economy deliver a sustainability de/finition based on packaging waste reduction and support it by the implementation of several tools and requirements (European Commission, 2015, 2019, 2020). /T\_his approach may not capture the complexity that food packaging has. Food packaging must serve some critical basic functions, but developing such packages nowadays is more of a balancing act between costs and bene/fits to reach an equilibrium (e.g., less packaging or more food waste). For example, it has to protect the food from external in/fluences (physical, chemical and biological) throughout the supply chain (including

many stages such as point of purchase, use at home and post-use), maintain its safety and quality during the given shelf life, refrain from releasing harmful substances into the food, respond to the highest safety standards, which are set by regulatory agencies (Begley et al., 2005),  provide  visual  product  quality  cues  and  other  relevant information important for consumers' trust and ultimately reduce food waste and loss. All of these aspects are of critical importance. Furthermore, the requirements for packaging may be di/fferent for the same product in di/fferent supply chains (e.g.: kept at ambient, cold, or frozen storage), causing increased complexities.

Food packaging has a special place in the plastic packaging debate since 40% of the plastic produced, namely PE, PP, PET and PS, is being used in food packaging applications (Plastics Europe, 2021), and the use of plastic in this domain is seen by consumers as a problem larger than climate change (Otto et al., 2021). Selecting the right packaging method, material and tailoring properties according to the needs of the food product (/fit-for-purpose packaging as reported by Verghese et  al., 2015) is a critical aspect, since every product has its own characteristics, thereby having product-speci/fic requirements. All those  factors  add  complications  when  striving  for  sustainable harmonization and obviously cause a new set of challenges at the end of life of the particular packaging material (Bauer et al., 2021).

Hence, harmonization is required to ensure uniform strategies when de/fining packaging sustainability and packaged food supply systems, across all actors. Furthermore, clear communication to and from policymakers is needed-especially in industry sectors where producers are  overburdened  by  cost,  legislation,  and  strict  but  sometimes overwhelmingly skewed compliance requirements. A commonly agreed holistic de/finition of sustainable food packaging would show how sustainability can be  assessed for food products, would accelerate progress, alleviate the discourse, and would assist in the establishment of e/ffective collaborations among stakeholders. In addition, this agreement will also reduce greenwashing by avoiding the fashionable e/ffects of certain terms relating to sustainability, used wrongly or rightly, making more complex the consumer's choice in the end and the work of industrials really invested in reducing the environmental impact.

/T\_herefore, the aims of this article are (1) to clarify the currently used terms and de/finitions for sustainable food packaging, (2) to identify critical issues which are relevant to the topic, and (3) to o/ffer an updated and holistic consensus de/finition for sustainable food packaging. /T\_his work was carried out by a vast group of researchers engaged in di/fferent disciplines of food packaging and with diverse research  backgrounds,  therefore,  this  new  de/finition  intends  to consider the entire value chain, which extends from raw material resources all the way to post consumer processing of the packaging material. Contrary to previous de/finitions, this de/finition aims to be speci/fic to food packaging and be simple yet coherent, holistic and harmonic, easily understandable, and communicable to everybody. Moreover, this article is written with the undisguised goal of starting an international dialog on this very impactful and dynamic subject.

## 2. Methodology

## 2.1. Analysis framework

/T\_he  analysis  framework  consisted  of  three  steps.  Firstly,  a systematic (narrative) review analysis was performed using Web of Science. Articles in a 20 years' time range (2002 to July 2022) were

extracted to create a knowledge database. /T\_he search string was composed of the following keywords and /fields: 'Topic: Food'; 'All /fields: Packaging'; Abstract: 'sustainability', 'sustainable', 'environmental',  'circular',  'green',  'eco-friendly'  or  'eco  friendly'. Boolean operators 'AND' and 'OR' were used to combine the three de/fined research /fields and keywords. If needed, additional articles were also employed for analysis to further clarify some of the concepts. /T\_he  descriptive  results  of  the  literature  search  are  described  in Section 2.2.

In the second phase, relevant articles were qualitatively analyzed to review the terminology, to identify critical issues and to create an updated de/finition for sustainable packaging. /T\_hirdly, a technique similar  to  Delphi  (structured  communication  with  qualitative analyzing approach) was used in two rounds to complete the initial review of the terminology, to re/fine the list of critical issues and to /finalize the new de/finition. Similar methodologies are o/f\_ten used in many  areas  of  science  to  /find  a  consensus  of  a  group  of experts'opinion with controlled opinion feedback (Dalkey and Helmer,  1963;  Hasson  and  Keeney,  2011;  Niederberger  and Spranger, 2020), and it serves an important basis for evaluating previous results and o/f\_ten useful when opinions from an expert group are presumably more accurate than those from unstructured groups (Niederberger and Spranger, 2020), especially in a /field where incomplete knowledge is evident (Giannarou and Zervas, 2014). First, a small panel of experts (a group of 5 experts; without anonymity) was selected based on interdisciplinarity and expertise in the /field of sustainable packaging. During a series of online meetings all experts presented their views, then responses were collected, con/flicting viewpoints were identi/fied, analyzed and discussed until consensus was reached. /T\_he group's views were analyzed qualitatively, and the initial text was modi/fied accordingly. In the second round a larger panel was constructed (a group of 20 experts including the previous experts) to collect di/fferent views in written form. Again, viewpoints were identi/fied, analyzed and discussed until consensus was reached.

As a result, a review of terminology arranged based on agreed relevance (Table 1; discussed in Section 3.1), a review of challenges (Table 2; discussed in Section 3.2) and the new de/finition (discussed in Section 4) for sustainable packaging were established.

## 2.2. General search results

/T\_he search with the keyword 'food' as a topic narrowed down the search to 854,551 references, while 'packaging' limited the search to 121,981 references. A/f\_ter applying the 'sustainability' keyword (or a synonym  such  as  'sustainable',  'environmental',  'circular',  'green', 'eco-friendly' or 'eco friendly') the article search resulted in a database of 3,850 references.

In general, results show that the food packaging community at large,  which  includes  researchers,  practitioners,  industry  and marketing  experts,  has  been  increasingly  focused  on  /finding sustainable  packaging  solutions  for  food  products.  /T\_his  is  well re/flected in Figure 1, where the number of publications related to 'sustainable food packaging' have exponentially grown in the past 20 years with a steep increase in the years between 2019 and 2022. /T\_he trend can be assumed to continue in the near future, which makes the aim of this article especially relevant.

Results also show limited integration between disciplines, or connections between consumers, materials and food (see Figure 2). /T\_he lack of multidisciplinary research can also be a reason for missing clear de/finitions in the food packaging topic. For example, a large number of articles are related to technical (material) /fields, such as antimicrobial substances to increase product shelf life. While other articles use more general terms and focus on consumer related issues without material related terms. Moreover, the absence of terms related to end of life also indicates the need for a more integrated (holistic) approach in this /field, which can be completed /first in a de/finition that can be easily understood by everyone.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Previously used terms and definitions of sustainable packaging

Di/fferent  terms  used  in  previous  research  for  sustainable packaging were reviewed (see Table  1, which summarizes the 38 di/fferent  packaging  terms  related  to  the  concept  of  sustainable packaging). All these terms highlight the (reduction of) impact that packaging has on the environment or society (Ilgin and Gupta, 2010; Prakash and Pathak, 2017; Nguyen et al., 2020; Zeng and Durif, 2020). /T\_he used terms have been summarized in four clusters: 'Sustainable packaging' , 'Circular packaging' , ' Bio packaging ' and 'Other sustainable' .

## 3.1.1. Sustainable packaging

Packaging solutions in this category include the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach based on economic, social, and environmental impacts (Jain and Hudnurkar, 2022) and their integration into the life cycle of the packaging material-from cradle to grave-throughout each stage of the supply chain. Terms like environmentally friendly and green packaging are o/f\_ten used as synonyms for sustainable packaging, therefore those were also put in this category; however, these are not necessarily synonyms. When describing sustainable packaging, authors either used their own de/finitions or the de/finitions by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (2005, 2009) or the Sustainable Packaging Alliance (2004). /T\_hese de/finitions o/ffer a valuable starting point, but have also been criticized earlier in literature (Grönman et al., 2013). It is also noted that sustainable packaging always comes with an environmental impact, therefore 'more' and 'less' sustainable packaging would be a more appropriate term (Boz et al., 2020), or the concept of 'sustainable packaging' should be deconstructed, because this absolute value is rather utopic. Moreover, these terms do not refer, at least directly, to the potential of reducing food waste, although this may be sometimes the case, and are mostly focused on avoiding unnecessary packaging, overpackaging or single-use plastics, thus reducing  the  direct  environmental  consequences  of  the  use  of the materials.

## 3.1.2. Circular packaging

Packages  in  this  category  are  designed  according  to  the principles of the circular economy. Recyclable, recycled, reusable and zero waste are o/f\_ten considered as similar terms, and so grouped together. Circular packaging can be  seen as one way toward sustainability due to the reduction in new resources entering the system. It can be  regarded as a subcategory of sustainable

/T\_he order of the challenges was established based on relevance.

packaging, however the concept shi/f\_ts the focus more to the lifecycle (resource cycles) and to the end of life of the material (Testa et al., 2020), in spite of the fact that avoidance should be the highest priority in the decision tree. Re-introducing a material to avoid the use of virgin resources may at times be costly, or very di/fficult to

be proven safe (Nerín et al., 2022; Tsochatzis et al., 2022). Reusing, mechanical  or  chemical  recycling  are  all  within  the  circular packaging de/finition, and the origin of the material (e.g.: from renewable sources, fossil fuel) or the amount of resources (energy, raw materials, etc) are not included in the de/finitions. /T\_heir end of life can also be quite varying, for example, in the case of compostable materials, their conditions for compostability may vary from simple household composting to complex industrial composting. Similarly, recycling  can  be  chemical,  mechanical,  and  may  result  in  a downgrade of the material. Furthermore, in this category of terms, there is no reference to the speci/fic functions (i.e., protection) that the packaging material may impart to the food.

## 3.1.3. Bio packaging

/T\_his is a diverse and slightly ill-de/fined category, since packages in this category  can  also  be  those  labeled  'compostable,' 'bio-degradable,' 'oxo-degradable,' or 'bio-based.' /T\_hese packages are highlighting the origin of the packaging material and/or its ability to degrade. /T\_he materials can be made from renewable sources (e.g.: second generation feedstocks), or are in some cases fossil-based. Plastic material made from bio-based material may not necessarily be bio-degradable. /T\_his broad group of packaging could be regarded as a subcategory of sustainable packaging, however, one must consider the material's origin, and especially in the case of displacement of food crops with biomass waste or residues, e.g., unavoidable agricultural or forestry wastes as well as their potential degradability at end of life alternative (Cruz et al., 2022). Moreover, such terms are a big source of confusion not only among consumers, therefore could lead to an environmental risk in the long term.

## 3.1.4. Other sustainable packaging

Packages in this category ful/fill certain aspects of sustainability (Lewis et al., 2007, 2010; Santi et al., 2022), which looks at broader solutions for sustainable packaging, leading to e/ffective, e/fficient, cyclic and safe practices. For example, re/fills, innovative and lightweight packages indicate solutions which bring signi/ficant improvements to current practices, and to some extent also are easily demonstrating to the end user (i.e., consumer) the improved function; for example, they lead to minimizing food waste, decrease plastic littering, or improving waste sorting are indicated in the de/finitions. /T\_hese can be  also considered as a subcategory of sustainable packaging.

<!-- image -->

Based on the numerous (38) expressions collected, one can conclude that, unfortunately, literature uses too many terms, of which many are very similar (see synonyms such as 'Environmentally friendly', 'Eco-friendly',  'Ecologically  responsible',  'Ecologically conscious', 'Pro-environmental', 'Eco-designed). In many cases the de/finitions are super/ficial and cannot be used outside of the context they belong to. /T\_he de/finitions treat the three pillars of sustainability (natural, human, and economic capital; Hansmann et  al., 2012) unequally, and the environment gets the most focus. Moreover, there is little emphasis on the role (responsibility) that the actors (i.e., consumers, managers) may play, and, more importantly, these terms do not relate the packaging together with the product, which in food is a grave simpli/fication. /T\_he use of technical terms also may present communication challenges, as this may hinder the public (mostly consumers, but also journalists and managers) to understand, evaluate and  make  appropriate  practical  decisions.  Hence,  the  current de/finitions of sustainable packaging are too complex and cannot be communicated well because consumers and other stakeholders do not have enough abilities (will) to process this information (Dörnyei et al., 2017). All these factors can lead to the so-called problem of 'information overload', or worse, to misleading communication of sustainable packaging (greenwashing).

## 3.2. Challenges and reasons for updating sustainable food packaging

A review of the literature also brings up some of the important challenges in relation to re-de/fining the concept of food packaging sustainability (see Table 2).

<!-- image -->

## 3.2.1. The protection of food products takes center stage

Packaging exists because of the product. /T\_his is especially true for food products, where packaging can be regarded as an added service (Löfgren, 2005; Löfgren et al., 2008). /T\_herefore, the packaging solution needs to ensure, /first and foremost, without compromises, the quality and safety of the food it contains (Han et al., 2018). However, this sometimes includes over-packing with the use of unnecessary long shelf life (o/f\_ten forced by retailers) instead of optimal shelf life or 'just necessary packaging' (Co/ffigniez et al., 2021). Food packaging and shelf life extension is a balance between the packaging and waste. Longest shelf life sometimes is not necessary, especially in areas where logistic and technological infrastructure make it possible to consume food in a much shorter time or if products are on average sold much before the expiration date. When long distances are instead critical to provide consumers with healthy and a/ffordable choices (i.e., remote locations) long shelf life is critical to avoiding food waste. /T\_his means that the materials have a veri/fiable means to ensure - among others - no chemical components in amounts that can endanger the health of the consumers should migrate from the environment (and from the packaging material) into the food, or release micro/nanoplastics in the environment. Such a product centered approach of packaging is very unique to the food packaging /field and signi/ficantly complicates the adoption and validation of universal sustainable packaging solutions.

## 3.2.2. The food product-package is one inseparable unit

To evaluate and measure the sustainability of packaged food products, the product and (and not necessarily only the primary) container should be regarded as a unit with a common environmental footprint, and the material should not be evaluated alone itself, nor the food (Meherishi et al., 2021). In particular, for food, it should be emphasized that primary packaging prevents food waste, which is a very important aspect of the environmental footprint (DilkesHo/ffman  et  al.,  2018;  Molina-Besch  et  al.,  2019).  Food  waste contributes to a signi/ficant amount of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the food, and once it is processed, all resources used are part of the /final balance. /T\_he package is only a portion of the entire footprint (Crippa et al., 2021). Hence, no sustainable solutions can be  found  where  the  quality  and  shelf  life  of  the  product are compromised.

## 3.2.3. For food packaging both direct and indirect sustainability e/ffects must be considered

Environmental impacts related to food packaging could be the result of direct (refer to the impacts caused during production, consumption,  and  disposal)  or  indirect  (refer  to  the  impacts generated by the industries that supply the /final production point) e/ffects on the environment (Lindh et al., 2016). While the negative direct e/ffects of packages are usually considered in sustainability evaluations, the positive or negative indirect e/ffects that packaging could provide through food product protection, supply chain, or sorting and end of life are not always included. In case of packaged food products, the two environmental e/ffects need to be considered together (de Koeijer et al., 2017) as including indirect e/ffects may show very di/fferent overall environmental impact, depending on the food-packaging system (Williams and Wikström, 2011; Wikström et al., 2016).

## 3.2.4. Food packaging is a resource, not litter

Packaging is a people-made novel entity (Persson et al., 2022), and it will always have a negative environmental cost; it is not possible to have packaging materials with no impact on the environment. All packaging material has an environmental footprint (Morgan et al., 2022), and there is a cost associated with the resources used, even when recycled or reused. In the case of food products, it is important to quantitatively measure the environmental footprint of the food, from cradle to grave, including the packaging material with its own life-cycle (if circular). Furthermore, the added value the package can o/ffer needs to be taken into consideration, together with any littering or recovering e/fforts (consumer behavior is very important in the late stages of the life cycle), as well as any reduction in food waste. Food packaging then should be  considered as an additional, valuable resource  integral  part  of  the  food  product,  and  can  no  longer be considered of low value, ending up in litter or waste.

## 3.2.5. Avoidance of food packaging is not always the best option

As with many resources employed in the food system, complete avoidance of the packaging use should be the preferred solution, but only if this does not have a detrimental e/ffect on the safety and quality of the product or on minimizing food waste (Beitzen-Heineke et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2020). In particular, minimizing food waste needs to be the primary goal. On average, packaging is estimated to account for only 10% of the total energy inputs for one person's weekly consumption of food, while it plays a critical role in ensuring that the other 90% of energy inputs to the supply chain are not wasted (Verghese  et  al.,  2015).  Instead,  a  critical  hierarchy  needs  to be established, and it has to be related to an overall decrease of the footprint, as quanti/fied for example using a life cycle assessment (LCA), which takes into consideration all resources, as well as the end of life and food waste (Nguyen et al., 2020), and a social life cycle assessment  (SLCA),  which  is  aimed  at  evaluating  social  and socioeconomic aspects of product-packaging units (Jørgensen, 2013).

## 3.2.6. Sustainable food packaging development, in practice, is a balancing act

A well designed package needs to ful/fill basic important functions, such as protection, storage, loading and transport, marketing, sale, promotion and communication, and impart trust of the food to the consumer, a 'guarantee' of its quality and consistency (Molina-Besch et al., 2019; Ketelsen et al., 2020); all of this while also satisfying any sustainability requirements originating from the entire life of the product-package  unit,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  logistics, production, engineering, material sources, end of life functions such as sorting, composting or recycling (Lindh et al., 2016; Wandosell et al., 2021). A sustainable packaging can be achieved by operating on three di/fferent levels: (1) at the level of raw materials (through the use of recycled raw materials, renewable resources or deriving from the revaluation of industrial processing waste); (2) at the production level (through more energy e/fficient processes); and (3) at the level of eco-design (through the reduction of thicknesses and weights; the realization of mono materials, fully recyclable structures in alternative to heterogeneous, multi material packaging, which are harder to sort; the realization of biodegradable and/or compostable packaging, in alternative  to  fossil  fuel-based  materials).  In  order  to  provide sustainable packaging with satisfying performance suitable for food

applications, it is fundamental to implement appropriate innovative functionalization strategies; among these, the use of nanotechnologies, blending  and/or  /filling  technologies,  the  development  of  active packaging, the realization of high performance active and passive coatings  and  layers  orientation.  /T\_he  combination  of  multiple requirements and sustainability implementation possibilities makes sustainable packaging development an extremely di/fficult balancing act  which  is  hard  to  measure.  As  a  consequence,  in  practice, sustainability in packaging development is still limited (de Koeijer et al., 2017).

## 3.2.7. Multidisciplinary approach is needed to create sustainable food packaging solutions

Packaging  sustainability  is  de/fined  and  measured  di/fferently depending on the discipline (Jiménez-Guerrero et al., 2015; Martinho et al., 2015; Han et al., 2018; Herbes et al., 2020; Zeng and Durif, 2020; Wandosell et  al., 2021;  Zeng et  al., 2021). For example, from the materials engineering perspective packaging sustainability means balancing  resource  use  while  optimizing  the  properties  of  the packaging source material (e.g.: ease in processability, low energy consumption, or less use of chemicals in production or end of life). In this case sustainability is mostly measured by LCA (Steenis et al., 2018). /T\_he process is not easy, especially if data input is poor (Radonjič, 2019), but at least with LCA it is possible to give an exact answer between scenarios. On the other hand, from a marketing perspective, packaging is an essential tool to communicate and in/fluence consumers (Dörnyei and Lunardo, 2021), deliver information, and aid in decision making. In this case the e/ffectiveness of a package is mostly measured by consumers' willingness to buy, and sustainability is only applied with designs that facilitate sales goals. Companies have clear ambitions with regard to improving food packaging sustainability; but not at the expense of product's market potential. However, as far apart as the two disciplines are at the current time, they must work together to /find optimal sustainable packaging solutions for food products.

## 3.2.8. Not all food packaging innovation is sustainable

When  developing  innovative  sustainable  food  packaging solutions, challenges of technological nature, concerning materials and processes, can be encountered. For example, in an attempt to replace fossil-fuel-based plastics, the use of renewable materials in bio-plastics is steadily growing (Cruz et al., 2022; Rosenboom et al., 2022;  Shlush and Davidovich-Pinhas, 2022). Although the use of bio-plastic is associated with positive consumer perception (Herbes et  al., 2018), these materials may not be necessarily compostable, biodegradable, recyclable, or may be a challenge to sort depending on the economies of scale in the various municipalities. In addition, some technological  properties  of  these  materials  are  still  not  fully satisfactory, hindering their large market uptake. Among these, raw material  variability,  a  too  narrow  processing  window,  inherent brittleness,  poor  barrier  properties,  scarce  impact  and  thermal resistance. As for the processes, a fundamental requirement for the implementation of innovative sustainable packaging solutions on a large scale is industrial feasibility. In general, non-invasive innovations compared to conventional technologies (e.g., redesigning packaging by reducing thickness and weight) are excellent options for improving current practices and are generally welcomed and accepted by all stakeholders. On the other hand, more invasive innovations (for

example the use of new materials or 'niche' technological innovations, not  compatible  with  conventional  manufacturing  processes  or machin-ability) o/f\_ten raise a number of additional problems along the value chain, will rarely meet industrial acceptance and may create confusion and slow down acceptance and implementation (Morone and Imbert, 2020).

## 3.2.9. Context (local) is key to food packaging sustainability

Determining the sustainability of the food packaging solution by omitting the context in which the solution exists can lead to incorrect evaluations. /T\_he context, i.e., country of origin, consumption region and supply chains, speci/fic product features, and user (consumer) habits, plays a major role in determining packaging sustainability (Lindh et al., 2016). For example, an LCA analysis of packaging for olive oil demonstrated that while glass bottles are preferable for local distribution, tinplate cans are more sustainable for long-distance distribution (Guiso et al., 2016). /T\_herefore, including more contextspeci/fic factors into sustainable packaging evaluations will lead to more sustainable and transparent solutions, toward true harmonization of sustainable packaging in the marketplace.

## 3.2.10. Regulatory landscape of sustainable food packaging is not fully comprehensive

Sustainable packaging is not yet properly de/fined by law, current regulations are not comprehensive and o/f\_ten misleading to some extent, which makes it a challenge to design truly sustainable packaging solutions.  Similarly,  unnecessary  packaging  is  also  an  ill-de/fined concept. Labeling regulations are also limited: uses of claims (symbol, color) which falsely convey that the package is more sustainable than the  alternative  in  the  market  can  be  misleading  and  lead  to greenwashing (Boz et al., 2020). It is then clear the need for a shared regulatory framework, which constitutes a guideline for the sustainable design of packaging and is supported by consumer engagement, through a more transparent communication (Dörnyei et al., 2022).

## 3.2.11. Consumer knowledge and awareness on sustainable food packaging is limited

Recent studies highlight that consumers show increasing concern about  sustainability issues, and  sustainability a/ffected food consumption  is  becoming  a  genuine  driver  of  choice  (Trivium Packaging, 2022). It is critical therefore that consumers are provided with information on the sustainability of the food package, and that there are clear instructions also on how to dispose of the food package at the post consumer phase. Indeed, the consumer is mindful of the environment but is o/f\_ten poorly informed about speci/fic issues, for example, the degree of sustainability of the various materials and the context in which they are used. Consumers are o/f\_ten not able to distinguish between industrial composting and household (home-) composting, in addition, there is no real control (composition, rest of plastic fragments, etc) on the compost made at home, which may result  in  more  littering.  Recent  evidence  also  shows  that  the sustainability rating of European consumers and scienti/fic LCAs currently are misaligned (Otto et al., 2021). Moreover, complexity in use of terms (as already described above) also hinders consumer understanding of truly sustainable packaging choices. Consumer knowledge about packaging sustainability needs to be improved to prevent and avoid greenwashing at consumer but also at industry level.

## 3.2.12. Food packaging is an information source on both product and packaging sustainability

As one of the main contacts in the consumer journey, the package itself has increasingly become an e/ffective way to communicate with consumers and other stakeholders about sustainability (Wyrwa and Barska, 2017). Consumers use multiple attributes and cues, such as packaging design (Otto et al., 2021), verbal attributes (e.g., text labels, logos and other cues), symbolic and text-based cues (Dinh et al., 2022) to evaluate the sustainability of the food product (such as product composition or shelf-life) and its packaging (such as showing garbage sorting instructions; Magnier and Crié, 2015). /T\_his dual task can sometimes confuse users if not su/fficiently explicit.

## 4. Updated and holistic definition for sustainable food packaging

/T\_he  search  for  sustainable  packaging  solutions  is  constantly evolving.  /T\_hanks  to  innovation  in  the  food  packaging  /field, technological advances, and impact assessment methodologies, a /fixed de/finition  of  packaging  sustainability  is  logically  not  possible. However, results provided in this work suggest that there are some major aspects that contribute to a sustainability de/finition for food packaging. A de/finition that includes all these aspects while giving space to future innovation is required (Santi et al., 2022). /T\_herefore, a holistic de/finition of 'sustainable food packaging' is proposed here to be used by the broader food packaging community, in both scienti/fic and mainstream publications.

Sustainable food packaging is an optimized, measured (quanti/fied) and validated solution, which takes into consideration the balance of social, economic, ecological and safe implementations of the circular value chain, based on the entire history (life cycle) of the food productpackage unit.

While the holistic de/finition was created speci/fically for the food domain, it can be also applied to other areas with minor changes. /T\_he de/finition o/ffered takes into consideration the balance of the lowest possible use of resources (e.g.: rational use of ecologically available resources, avoidance of unnecessary overconsumption) and at the same time all direct and indirect environmental impacts. It includes all aspects of the food-packaging unit, as well as all stakeholders and actors needs along the supply chain, while being e/fficient, e/ffective, cyclic and safe (Lewis et  al., 2007,  2010). Furthermore, it should be produced from renewable sources, preferably using land and water resources that do not displace food and feed. /T\_his holistic perspective is  key  to  the  ability  to  take  into  consideration  food  safety  and packaging functionality into the equation, including consumers, who play a key role in ensuring that the intended design is implemented.

/T\_he analysis of de/finitions also shows the necessity to broaden and deepen  the  aspects  of  measurement  and  metrics  of  sustainable packaging  and  to  open  a  new  debate  in  future  publications. Measurement is an important step of the current de/finition, however exact measures that would be associated with this new de/finition is not o/ffered here. /T\_here are a plethora of metrics to assess packaging sustainability (e.g.: LCA, Ellen McArthur Circularity index), and the landscape is dynamic, o/f\_ten new metrics emerge. Although the measurement of sustainability is still not a fully harmonized practice and o/f\_ten under debate, it should be made a priority to have systems in place that allow comparisons between solutions as they become available. It is then clear that there is a need to come up not only with

a common de/finition, but a 'standard' to evaluate sustainability in this /field. /T\_his would reduce the number of vague, confusing, or even misleading claims, and align common metrics for what sustainability is really about. As there are already problems with the ESG reporting skewing by the companies due to vague framework and assessment, the terminology and research must include strictly measured data with well de/fined goals, metrics and research framework.

It is then not only important to choose the appropriate material, and to  design  the  appropriate  packaging  solution,  but  also  awareness, education, and communication to the end users are required to ensure that the package solution ends up being treated and used the way it is intended. Compostability, recyclability, reuse rates for food packaging will continue to be limited if the practical implementation challenges (such as infrastructure) are not overcome, and unless the entire community does not resort to harmonized policies that reduce these practical challenges. In the case of food packaging, a consumer centered approach is key to ensure that the material does not end up as litter or land/fill.

Being a balancing act, a sustainable food package solution may not be  perfect,  but  contextual,  suboptimal  and  in  need  of  constant validation. It is important to note that food product designers, food scientists and food packaging practitioners have in common the social responsibility to /find the best solution, even when it is not necessarily easy, a/ffordable or convenient, and when it may require organizational changes, as we strive to reach global sustainability goals.
